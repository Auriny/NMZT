# No More Zombie Threads
Did you ever had your server refuse to shut down after running **/stop**? Annoying, right? That’s because some mod developers forgets to close async threads, preventing the server from shutting down properly.

**NMZT** fixes this by forcefully terminating any lingering "zombie" threads **after** the world and playerdata have been safely saved. No more manually killing your server process after every restart or crash — **NMZT** handles it for you. 
## ✅ Features:
- Fully automatic. You can literally just put the mod in your mods folder and completely forget about this problem.
- Lightweight. This mod implements only 2 hooks into the vanilla code and nothing else, so it will NOT reduce the server performance.
- Safe. NMZT is 99.9% compatible with other mods, so I don't think it can break your world or modpack.
